// Freemium: Free stays free forever (the daily speech + 3 attempts). Premium
// unlocks everything and always opens with a 7-day free trial, billed on one
// of three cycles. The cycles are priced so the effective per-week rate falls
// as the commitment grows — weekly is the impulse rate, annual is the best
// deal — which is what makes the longer plans the obvious value.
//
// When Stripe is wired, fill in `stripePriceId` for each cycle; the checkout
// button looks the plan up by cycle. Nothing downstream changes: the webhook
// writes `plan: "premium"` on users/{uid}/profile/plan (see lib/plan.ts).
